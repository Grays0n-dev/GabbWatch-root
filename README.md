Rooting is the process of gaining access to a device's operating system and gaining administrative control. It's most commonly used to refer to Android devices, but is similar to jailbreaking Apple iOS devices. 
Rooting gives users the ability to: 

    Customize the device's look and feel
    Install custom themes
    Download specialized apps
    Replace or alter system applications and settings
    Change the operating system
    Improve performance
    Uninstall apps that can't be removed
    Get rid of bloatware
    Overclock the phone's processor
    Access more RAM 

However, rooting can also cause a number of issues, including: Voiding the warranty, Damaging the device, Losing data, Allowing access for malware, and Rendering the phone useless. 
Rooting is generally not recommended unless you have significant technical knowledge.
